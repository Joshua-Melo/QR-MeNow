# Requirements
## 1. Positioning
___
### 1.1 Problem Statement
The problem of sharing large amounts of contact information and social media affects many young and busy
people the impact of which is a lot of time wasted by the error prone process of entering in large amounts of
information manually.
### 1.2 Product Position Statement
For all people who frequently share significant amounts of contact information QR MeNow is a QR code
generating webapp that allows users to share contact information efficiently; unlike manually entering
in your contact information every time, QR MeNow allows users to only input their information a single
time then share a single QR code from then on.

   a website with an app as a stretch goal.

2. __Developers__: <br>
   The developers have a stake in the product because they are putting their time and effort into creating it.

## 5. MVP
___
Our minimum viable product needs to allow a user to access our service through a webapp. The user will need to be
able to register contact information or social media account information that is stored for later retrieval. They
will then need to be able to generate a QR code that, when scanned, takes the scanner to a page displaying all of
the user's contact information. This QR code needs to persist for later retrieval by the user. We can validate these
features by having anyone (a potential end-user, or one of the devs) access the website, input some contact
information, generate a QR code, then scan that QR code with an external device and ensure that it brings them to a
page containing the registered contact information.

__User Story 10:__ As a user, I would like to be able to configure a QR code to only have a limited number of
