# 1. Introduction
QR-MeNow is your new personal business card. Swapping contact information can be an
arduous process that is prone to human error. To help simplify the process QR-MeNow uses QR codes
to store and share arbitrary contact information including but not limited to: LinkedIn,
phone numbers, email addresses, social media, personal websites and more. Your personal QR
code can be configured to only be valid for a limited amount of time or a limited number
of uses, or to only display the pertinent contact information for the situation.

# 2. Initial Value Proposition and Consumer Segments
## 2.1. Initial Value Proposition
Free time these days is severly limited, don't waste yours typing in contact information
and worrying about whether you entered it correctly or not. Just configure a QR code once
and use it to share all of your information as many times as you want.
## 2.2. Initial Consumer Segments
- Busy people
- People with a lot of contact information
- Small businesses
- People with a lot of social media
- Young people
- People who do a lot of networking
# 3. Interviews Summary
__Summary__: Discussed when and why this app may be useful. Said she may be interested
if the UI were clean. Has always wanted a way to swap all social media and contact info at once.

__Interviewer__: Anthony <br>
__Interviewee__: Diandra Katia <br>
__When__: 2/8/2021 <br>
__Consumer Segments__:

- Young people
- People with a lot of social media

__Key Insights__

- Would prefer free with ads because she never buys apps
- Could be useful for immediate mass swapping of info (as suspected)

__Representative quotes__

- "Sharing all of my contact info individually can be painful"
- "Sometimes I think I've given someone one of my social accounts then it turns out I never did"
- "The page the QR code takes me to needs to be well layed out and clear"

__Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don't care__

- Support any arbitrary contact info: Must
- Automactically send friend requests on QR code scan: Nice (probably not feasible)
- Configure which contact info is shared by QR code: Must
- Ability to post (or at least link to) QR code from elsewhere: Must
- Limit QR codes to time/number of usages: Don't care

__Summary__: Was not particularly interested. Mostly uses only LinkedIn for networking. This suggests that
more professional people may not be interested as they will have a LinkedIn, and if they have a personal
website or anything it will probably be on their LinkedIn.

__Interviewer__: Anthony <br>
__Interviewee__: David Rodriguez <br>
__When__: 2/9/2021 <br>
__Consumer Segments__:

- Young people
- People who do a lot of networking

__Key Insights__

- If people are only sharing maybe one or two pieces of contact info they may prefer to just do it manually
- Scanning a QR code is impersonal which may not be desirable in professional networking

__Representative quotes__

- "I usually tell them my LinkedIn and we add each other then and there"
- "I like my professional networking to feel more personal and involved, this feels too impersonal"

__Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don't care__

- don't care just in general
