# 1. Introduction
QR-MeNow is your new personal business card. Swapping contact information can be an
arduous process that is prone to human error. To help simplify the process QR-MeNow uses QR codes
to store and share arbitrary contact information including but not limited to: LinkedIn,
phone numbers, email addresses, social media, personal websites and more. Your personal QR
code can be configured to only be valid for a limited amount of time or a limited number
of uses, or to only display the pertinent contact information for the situation.
