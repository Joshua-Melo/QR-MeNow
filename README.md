# QR-MeNow
CS386 Software Engineering Project

QR MeNow is a QR code generating webapp that allows users to share contact information efficiently; unlike manually entering in your contact information every time, QR MeNow allows users to only input their information a single time then share a single QR code from then on. QR-MeNow is also a free selfhostable service that can be used by anyone with lots of contact information, social media, and more.
